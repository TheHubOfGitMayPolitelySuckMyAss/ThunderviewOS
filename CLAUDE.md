# Thunderview OS

Thunderview OS is the management system for Thunderview CEO Dinners — monthly startup CEO dinners in Colorado (~40 attendees), organized by Eric Marcoullier. It replaces a fragmented stack of Squarespace forms, Google Sheets, Streak CRM, and Eric's memory. Single source of truth for applications, members, tickets, credits, dinners, and intros/asks. Built on Next.js + Supabase, deployed on Vercel. This is a separate project from CoachingOS/DigiEric — separate repo, separate Supabase project.

## Operating rules (read first)

- Cloud-first. Vercel + Supabase. No local-only scripts or dependencies. Flag any local-only requirement for cloud migration automatically.
- Do NOT invent requirements. Build exactly what's specified. If something seems missing, flag it — don't fill it in.
- When Eric reports a bug, ask at least one clarifying question before offering an explanation. Don't infer the cause.
- Prefer omission over inference. If information is uncertain, say so explicitly.
- Don't validate, praise, or smooth ambiguity. Disagree when warranted.
- Workflow: Eric writes prompts, Claude Code executes. Default assumption: Claude Code does it unless stated otherwise.
- When Eric asks you to find a resource (token, file, config value) for a specific task, finding it is implicit authorization to use it for that task. Don't ask for permission to proceed.

## Canonical spec

The v4 handoff doc is the source of truth for product decisions. It lives outside the repo (in Eric's chat sessions) and Eric will paste relevant sections when needed. The handoff doc supersedes any conflicting comments or assumptions in the codebase.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16.2.3**, App Router, TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (via `@tailwindcss/postcss`)
- **Supabase**: `@supabase/supabase-js` ^2.103.2, `@supabase/ssr` ^0.10.2
- **Resend** ^6.11.0 (installed, not yet wired)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (production: https://thunderview-os.vercel.app)
- **Database**: Supabase project `volrbqcolrqarmquaqvy` (us-west-2)

## Key architectural decisions

- **Auth:** Magic link only via Supabase Auth. NO Google OAuth. Uses PKCE flow (`@supabase/ssr` default). Magic link emails route to `/auth/confirm?token_hash=...&type=email`. All auth routes redirect to `/portal` — role-based routing happens on the portal page.
- **Admin role:** `eric@marcoullier.com` is hard-coded as the sole admin.
- **Team role:** Any member with `is_team = true` AND `kicked_out = false`. Same admin UI access as admin.
- **Member role:** Portal-only access (Phase 4).
- **Role check:** Implemented via `is_admin_or_team()` Postgres function (SECURITY DEFINER) used in RLS policies. Also checked in proxy and admin layout.
- **Data model philosophy:** Three distinct tables — `applications` (vetting events, persist forever), `members` (current-standing approved people), `tickets` (paid entry for a specific dinner). Plus `credits` and `dinners`.
- **No row deletions.** Soft-delete via `kicked_out` flag on members. Rejected applications stay in the applications table — that table IS the rejection/suppression list.
- **Demographics (gender, race, orientation) live on `applications` only.** Never copied to `members`.
- **One Ask per member.** `members.current_ask` is overwritten on save. Prefill logic: `ask_updated_at > last_dinner_attended`.
- **Multi-email members.** Members can have multiple email addresses via the `member_emails` table. Lookups (auth, ticket matching, application matching) check against ALL of a member's emails. Primary email = the email on the member's most recent approved application; this is what's used for outbound communication. Primary flips automatically when a new application is approved with a different email. Tickets do NOT change primary email (Stripe autofill is noisy).
  - ~~TODO: When an application is approved with a different email than primary, flip primary to the application email.~~ Done — `approve_application` and `link_application_to_member` RPCs handle this.
  - TODO: When a ticket is fulfilled with an unrecognized email, insert a new `member_emails` row with `is_primary = false`, `source = 'ticket'` (add to fulfill action in Phase 3).

## Data model

Full schema in `supabase/migrations/20260415000000_initial_schema.sql` and `20260415100000_member_emails.sql`. Phase 2 schema additions (`email_status`, historical enum values) applied via `tmp/import.sql`.

- `dinners` — first-Thursday-of-month events, auto-generated 12 months out via Vercel Cron (`/api/cron/generate-dinner`), skipping Jan/Jul. Date is UNIQUE. Cron fires daily at 1pm UTC; handler runs only on the day after the first Thursday of each month.
- `applications` — vetting records with demographic data, status pending/approved/rejected, persist forever. `first_name` + `last_name` (same split as members). `member_id` is NULL until approved.
- `members` — approved people, soft-deletable via `kicked_out`. `first_name` + `last_name` (split from single `name` column; backfilled by splitting on first space). `attendee_stagetypes` is `TEXT[]` (not null, default `'{}'`) — supports multi-role membership (e.g. Active CEO + Investor). Note: `applications.attendee_stagetype` remains a single TEXT column; the application form is single-select. Key trigger-managed columns:
  - `has_community_access` BOOLEAN (renamed from `has_attended`) — set to `true` on ticket INSERT. Set to `false` on UPDATE when `kicked_out` flips false→true (trigger `trg_revoke_community_access_on_kickout`). Does NOT auto-restore on un-kick or on refund/credit. A future revoke checkbox on the refund flow will allow manual revert (not yet built).
  - `first_dinner_attended` DATE — set on ticket INSERT to the dinner's date if currently null. On refund/credit, reverts to null only if `first_dinner_attended` matches the refunded ticket's dinner date; otherwise unchanged.
  - `last_dinner_attended` DATE — set by `trg_ticket_fulfillment_change` when `fulfillment_status` transitions to `'fulfilled'` (not on INSERT — only on UPDATE). Set to the dinner's date if later than the current value. On refund/credit, recalculated as MAX of remaining fulfilled tickets' dinner dates; null if none remain. Because future-dinner tickets stay `pending` until auto-fulfill, `last_dinner_attended` only advances when the fulfillment cron or next-dinner auto-fulfill fires.
  - `marketing_opted_out_at` TIMESTAMPTZ — set to `now()` when `marketing_opted_in` flips to `false`, cleared to null when it flips back to `true`. Managed by trigger on UPDATE of `marketing_opted_in`.
  - `intro_updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ — tracks when the member last updated their own Intro. Column exists but no trigger — set explicitly by portal save action (Phase 4). Admin edits do not update this timestamp.
  - `ask_updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ — tracks when the member last updated their own Ask. No trigger — set explicitly by portal save action (Phase 4). Admin edits do not update this timestamp.
  - `profile_pic_url` TEXT NULL — full public URL to profile pic in Supabase Storage bucket `profile-pics`. Null = no pic. Set by portal profile save action.
  - `updated_at` — auto-set by trigger.
- `tickets` — paid entry tied to a member + dinner, with fulfillment lifecycle (pending/fulfilled/refunded/credited). Tracks payment source and match confidence. `fulfillment_status = 'fulfilled'` means "eligible for or already sent the dinner-details email." It does NOT mean "attended." Attendance is not tracked. The only reason fulfilled exists is to gate the fulfillment email. All paid tickets for future-beyond-next dinners stay `pending` until ~27 days before their dinner, when a cron flips them and sends the email (Phase 5, not yet built). Tickets for the next upcoming dinner auto-fulfill immediately on purchase. The webhook and comp ticket action only flip to fulfilled if `dinner_id` matches `getTargetDinner()`.
- `tickets` also supports historical imports: `payment_source = 'historical'`, `ticket_type = 'historical'`, `fulfillment_status = 'fulfilled'`, `amount_paid = 0`, no order ID, dinner date as both `purchased_at` and `fulfilled_at`.
- `credits` — outstanding/redeemed, tied to a source (refunded) ticket and optionally a redeemed ticket.
- `member_emails` — multiple emails per member. `is_primary` marks the canonical email. Partial unique index enforces at-most-one primary; constraint trigger enforces at-least-one. `source` tracks origin (application/ticket/manual). `email_status` is `'active'` (default) or `'bounced'`.

## Auth flow

1. User enters email at `/login`
2. Client calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp` with `emailRedirectTo` set to `${NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
3. Supabase sends magic link email (PKCE flow)
4. User clicks link → Supabase template routes to `/auth/confirm?token_hash=...&type=email` on our app
5. `/auth/confirm` route calls `supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type })`, sets session cookies via `cookieStore`
6. Both `/auth/confirm` and `/auth/callback` always redirect to `/portal` after successful auth, regardless of role. Portal page checks role and shows admin button for admin/team.
7. Proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) refreshes session on every request, protects `/admin/*` routes (unauthenticated → `/login`, non-admin/non-team → `/portal`), protects `/portal/*` routes (unauthenticated → `/login`, non-admin without `has_community_access = true` → `/`), and redirects authenticated users from `/login` to `/portal`. Since kick-out revokes `has_community_access` via trigger, no separate `kicked_out` check is needed in the portal guard.

**Gotcha:** `/auth/callback` (code exchange flow) also exists but the primary magic link flow uses `/auth/confirm` (token hash flow). Both are needed. The PKCE flow via `@supabase/ssr` generates email templates that use `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email`.

## Environment variables

Required in `.env.local` (see `.env.local.example` at repo root):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase publishable/anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase service role key (server-side only)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — App origin URL (`http://localhost:3000` for dev, `https://thunderview-os.vercel.app` for production)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — TBD, not yet wired. Not yet in `.env.local.example`; add when Resend is integrated.

Production values are set in Vercel dashboard. Preview scope is missing anon key and service role key (Vercel CLI plugin bug — add manually in dashboard if needed).

## Supabase configuration (manual, not in code)

These are configured in the Supabase dashboard, not in the codebase:

- **Site URL:** `https://thunderview-os.vercel.app`
- **Redirect URLs allowlist:** `https://thunderview-os.vercel.app/**` and `http://localhost:3000/**`
- **SMTP:** Currently using Supabase's built-in dev SMTP (rate-limited, has injected unsubscribe footer). Pre-launch must-do: switch to Resend custom SMTP.
- **Email templates:** Customized via Management API. See "Email template requirements" below.
- **Magic link rate limits:** Default — 1 request per 60 seconds per email, hourly cap on built-in SMTP.

### Email template requirements

Magic link and signup confirmation email templates MUST use `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email` as the link target — NOT the default `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`. The default generates a URL that verifies at Supabase's endpoint and redirects to the bare site root, which never establishes a session. The PKCE flow (used by `@supabase/ssr`) requires the token_hash format hitting our `/auth/confirm` route.

## What's done (Phase 1)

- Project scaffolded (Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4)
- Supabase clients: browser (`createBrowserClient`), server (`createServerClient` with cookies), admin (service role)
- Proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) for session refresh + `/admin` route protection
- Database schema: 6 tables (dinners, members, applications, tickets, credits, member_emails), indexes, `updated_at` trigger on members, primary-email constraint trigger on member_emails
- Multi-email support: `member_emails` table migration applied; `members.email` column dropped; `is_admin_or_team()` and "members can view own row" RLS policy rewritten to join through `member_emails`; admin pages (members, dinner detail, credits) read primary email via `member_emails`
- RLS enabled on all tables with `is_admin_or_team()` function (joins through `member_emails`) + "members can view own row" policy
- Magic link auth: login page, `/auth/confirm` (PKCE token hash), `/auth/callback` (code exchange), role-based redirect
- Supabase auth email templates updated to use PKCE token hash pattern (`{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email`)
- Admin layout: sidebar nav, header with user email + Admin/Team badge, sign-out
- 4 admin pages, all READ-ONLY: dinner view (with tickets + applications), applications inbox (filter + detail), members list (search + detail), credits (filter — later removed in Phase 3)
- Admin dinners list funnel columns (Applied, Approved, Paid, Intro/Ask) with clickable rows linking to dinner detail
- Derived "Intro/Ask" ticket status on dinner detail page: shown when `fulfillment_status = 'fulfilled'` AND member has both `current_intro` and `current_ask` AND `ask_updated_at > last_dinner_attended` (or no prior attendance)
- Portal placeholder ("Portal Coming Soon")
- Seed data applied to Supabase (10 dinners, 5 members, 3 applications, 5 tickets, 1 credit — replaced by Phase 2 import)

## What's done (Phase 2)

- Data migration from Google Sheets, Squarespace Orders, Squarespace Contacts, and Streak CRM. 632 members, 825 member_emails, 706 applications, 1,253 historical tickets, 32 dinners imported. 0 credits (none in historical data).
- Schema additions applied inline via `tmp/import.sql`: `member_emails.email_status` column (`active`/`bounced`), `'historical'` added to `tickets.payment_source` and `tickets.ticket_type` CHECK constraints.
- Import audit passed: FK integrity, primary email uniqueness, has_community_access/ticket consistency, marketing opt-out verification all clean.
- 65 bounced emails flagged via Squarespace cleaned export. 81 members opted out via Squarespace unsubscribed export.
- Import artifacts in `tmp/`: `import.sql` (generated SQL), `import_summary.txt`, `import_validation.txt`.

## What's done (Phase 3, in progress)

- Admin dashboard home page (`/admin`): next-dinner stats (date, days until, new apps, tickets sold), collapsible accordion sections (pending applications, marketing opt-outs).
- Schema: `marketing_opted_out_at` TIMESTAMPTZ on members, with trigger on `marketing_opted_in` changes; backfilled 85 existing opt-outs
- Schema: `first_dinner_attended` DATE on members; backfilled from earliest non-refunded/credited ticket
- Schema: renamed `has_attended` → `has_community_access` (all code references updated)
- Triggers on tickets: `trg_ticket_insert` (sets `has_community_access = true` on member, sets `first_dinner_attended` to dinner date if null), `trg_ticket_fulfillment_change` (on fulfill: sets `last_dinner_attended` if later than current; on refund/credit: recalculates `last_dinner_attended` as MAX of remaining fulfilled, reverts `first_dinner_attended` to null if it matched the refunded dinner)
- Dinner detail: "Approved Without Ticket" list replaces raw applications list. Before dinner date: approved apps whose member has no ticket for this dinner. After dinner date: approved apps whose member had no ticket purchased on or before the dinner date. Ticket rows link to member detail; application rows link to application detail.
- All list pages: sortable columns (click header to toggle asc/desc), sticky headers
- Members list: removed `kicked_out` and `is_team` columns; kicked-out members shown with full-row strikethrough
- Member detail page (`/admin/members/[id]`): server wrapper + client component. `<name> at <company>` heading with strikethrough for kicked-out (no pills — Team and Marketing Opt-Out are now toggles in column two). Column one: all fields editable inline — edit mode triggered by pencil icon on hover (all fields) or click-on-value (non-URL fields only). LinkedIn and Website remain clickable links; pencil icon is the only way to edit them. Editable fields: Name, Company, Type (dropdown), LinkedIn, Website, Intro (textarea), Ask (textarea), Contact Preference (dropdown). Email Addresses section: pencil icon (hover-only) or clicking any email opens the email management modal. Modal supports: add email (with duplicate validation against member_emails and applications), delete email (blocks last email), set primary (via `swap_primary_email` RPC). New emails: `source = 'manual'`. Column two: Application Date (earliest approved), Dinners list, Marketing Opted In toggle (immediate save, triggers `marketing_opted_out_at`), Team toggle (immediate save, admin-only — team members see label), Remove/Reinstate button with confirmation modal. Remove sets `kicked_out = true` + `marketing_opted_in = false`. Reinstate sets `kicked_out = false` + `marketing_opted_in = true`.
- Add Member modal on members list page: creates member + member_emails + approved application atomically via `add_member_with_application` RPC. Form: Name, Email, Company, Website, LinkedIn, Type, Gender/Race/Orientation dropdowns (default "Prefer not to say"), Preferred Dinner Date. Email validation checks member_emails and applications for duplicates. Success shows "[name] added!" modal.
- Application detail page (`/admin/applications/[id]`): server wrapper + client component. `<name> at <company>` heading with status pill (yellow pending, green approved, red rejected). "View member →" link when `member_id` exists. Approve button (shown when pending or rejected): `approve_application` RPC creates member + member_emails + updates application in single transaction. If email matches existing member, links without creating duplicate (re-application path) and flips primary email to application email. If existing member is kicked out, blocks with red warning + link to member page. Rejected-to-approved flip supported (clears rejection reason). Reject button (shown when pending): modal with reason dropdown ("Service Provider", "services business", "Other" with freeform input). "Link to existing member" button (shown when pending, no member_id): opens member search modal, links application to selected member via `link_application_to_member` RPC, adds/flips primary email. Blocked if selected member is kicked out. Email TODOs differentiated: template #1 for new member approval, template #2 for re-application/linked existing. Two-column layout unchanged.
- Detail pages are standalone routes, not inline modals. Table rows use `Link` to navigate to `/admin/members/[id]` or `/admin/applications/[id]`. Browser back button works correctly.
- Schema: `intro_updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ on members. No trigger — will be set explicitly by portal save action (Phase 4). Admin edits do not update this timestamp. No backfill — existing rows null.
- Timezone standardization: all date display and comparison logic uses America/Denver. Shared utilities in `src/lib/format.ts`: `formatDate()` (DATE or TIMESTAMPTZ → display string in MT), `formatTimestamp()` (TIMESTAMPTZ → display with time in MT), `getTodayMT()` (today as YYYY-MM-DD in MT), `toDateMT()` (TIMESTAMPTZ → YYYY-MM-DD in MT for comparisons). No raw `toLocaleDateString()` or `toISOString().slice()` calls remain in the codebase. Stored data is unchanged (TIMESTAMPTZ is UTC internally, DATE columns are timezone-agnostic).
- Display name cleanup: `formatStageType()` in `src/lib/format.ts` — "Active CEO (Bootstrapping or VC-Backed)" → "Active CEO", "Exited CEO (Acquisition or IPO)" → "Exited CEO"
- Members search input text color fixed (was invisible against background)
- Portal ticket purchase flow (`/portal/tickets`): authenticated members can buy tickets directly. Four-step flow: selection → guest upsell (December only) → cart review → success with confetti. Ticket type and price derived from member's `attendee_stagetype` (Active/Exited CEO → $40, Investor → $100, Guest → $40). Target dinner computed via `getTargetDinner()` in `src/lib/ticket-assignment.ts` (checks approved application preferred date first, falls back to next upcoming dinner). December dinners offer +1 guest ticket ($40). Single ticket row with `quantity` column (1 or 2). `payment_source = 'portal'`. Server action recomputes target dinner at submit time. Edge cases: existing pending ticket → blocked with message; kicked out → redirect to portal; no stagetype → contact Eric message; no upcoming dinner → error message.
- Schema: `quantity` INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 on tickets. `payment_source` CHECK updated to include `'portal'`.
- Proxy updated: `/portal/*` routes now redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- Portal page: "Buy Your Ticket" button shown for non-kicked-out members.
- Admin display: dinner detail and dinners list sum `quantity` for attendee counts (not row count). Ticket rows with `quantity > 1` display as "Name +1". Shared helper `formatTicketName()` in `src/lib/format.ts`.
- Dashboard: removed "Unfulfilled Tickets" accordion (no longer needed with portal ticket flow). Only pending applications and marketing opt-outs remain.
- Dinner detail redesigned: active tickets table (pending/fulfilled) with Credit and Refund action buttons per row; Type and Amount columns removed. Refunded/credited tickets shown in a separate bottom section with full-row strikethrough and status pills. Refund-only (no Credit) for qty=2 tickets.
- Refund flow: qty=1 sets `fulfillment_status = 'refunded'`, existing triggers recalculate dates. qty=2 offers "Refund Guest Only" (decrements quantity to 1, halves amount_paid, keeps status) or "Refund Both" (sets status to refunded). Confirmation modal for all refunds.
- Credit flow: sets ticket `fulfillment_status = 'credited'`, creates a `credits` row with `source_ticket_id` and `status = 'outstanding'`. Confirmation modal.
- Apply Credit on member detail page: "Apply Credit" button shown at top of column two when member has unredeemed credits (`credits.status = 'outstanding'` AND `redeemed_ticket_id IS NULL`). On confirm: computes target dinner via `getTargetDinner()`, inserts ticket as pending then updates to fulfilled (fires both insert and fulfillment triggers), sets `payment_source = 'credit'`, `amount_paid = 0`, marks oldest unredeemed credit as redeemed. Button stays visible if multiple credits remain.
- Kicked-out member exclusion from dinner views: approved applications whose linked member has `kicked_out = true` are excluded from dinner funnel counts (Applied/Approved columns on dinners list) and "Approved Without Ticket" lists on dinner detail pages. Applications inbox and tickets are unaffected.
- `/admin/tickets` page: cross-dinner ticket list with all 1,350+ tickets (paginated past the 1,000-row PostgREST cap). Columns: Purchased, Member (strikethrough if kicked out), Dinner (formatted "May 7th, 2026"), Qty, Amount, Type, Source, Status (colored pills). All columns sortable, default reverse-chron by purchased_at. Search by member name. Row click navigates to dinner detail.
- `/admin/credits` page removed. Credits now surface contextually: "Credit" button on dinner ticket rows, "Apply Credit" button on member detail. Nav updated: Tickets added between Dinners and Applications, Credits removed.
- Pagination audit: all admin list queries that could exceed the 1,000-row PostgREST cap now use the `fetchAll` helper with `.range()`. Paginated: applications (718 rows), members (634 rows), tickets (1,350 rows), dinners funnel aggregations (applications + tickets). Bounded queries (`.single()`, `.limit()`, count-only, scoped to single dinner/member) left as-is.

## What's done (Phase 4, in progress)

- Schema: `members.attendee_stagetype` (TEXT, singular) → `members.attendee_stagetypes` (TEXT[], NOT NULL DEFAULT `'{}'`). All 636 existing members backfilled to single-element arrays. The singular column is dropped. `applications.attendee_stagetype` is unchanged — application form remains single-select.
- RPCs `add_member_with_application`, `approve_application`, `link_application_to_member` now write `members.attendee_stagetypes = ARRAY[<application stagetype>]`. `link_application_to_member` previously did not touch member stagetype; it now overwrites. Re-approving an application overwrites any multi-role customization the member added — intentional for now.
- Pricing logic in `getTicketInfo()` (in `src/lib/ticket-assignment.ts`) now takes `string[]` and uses priority ladder: Active CEO → $40 (CEO Ticket); else Investor → $100; else Exited CEO → $40; else Guest → $40; fallback CEO Ticket $40. Active CEO trumps Investor when both are present.
- Trigger `trg_revoke_community_access_on_kickout` (BEFORE UPDATE OF kicked_out on members): when `kicked_out` flips false→true, sets `has_community_access = false`. Un-kicking does NOT auto-restore — admin must set manually if needed.
- Proxy `/portal/*` guard now requires `has_community_access = true` (admin email bypasses). Members without it redirect to `/`. With the kick-out trigger above, no separate `kicked_out` check is needed.
- Member detail Type field still single-select in the admin UI (Phase 4 will introduce multi-select); the admin server action wraps the chosen value in a single-element array when writing `attendee_stagetypes`.
- **Global top nav** (`src/components/top-nav.tsx`): renders on every authenticated page (portal + admin). Left: "Thunderview OS" logo → `/portal`. Center-left: Tickets → `/portal/tickets`, Community → `/portal/community`, Last Month's Intros & Asks → `/portal/recap`. Active-state highlighting. Right: avatar circle with member initials (first_name[0] + last_name[0]). Avatar dropdown: Update Profile → `/portal/profile`, Admin → `/admin` (admin/team only), Sign Out. Admin sidebar now sits below the top nav (was full-height). Admin shell header removed — top nav replaces it.
- **Portal layout** (`src/app/portal/layout.tsx`): wraps all `/portal/*` pages with TopNav. Fetches member data for initials + role. Auth check.
- **Portal home page** (`/portal`): two-column layout (stacks on mobile). Left column: four full-width nav buttons (Buy A Dinner Ticket → `/portal/tickets`, Update Your Profile → `/portal/profile`, View The Community → `/portal/community`, Check Last Month's Intros & Asks → `/portal/recap`). Right column: inline editable form with Intro/Ask/Contact. Single Save button with toast.
- **Portal save action** (`savePortalProfile` in `src/app/portal/actions.ts`): compares old vs new values; only writes changed fields. Sets `intro_updated_at = now()` only when Intro text actually changed; sets `ask_updated_at = now()` only when Ask text actually changed. Contact-only changes touch neither timestamp. No-op when nothing changed (no DB write, "No changes" toast). Admin edits elsewhere do NOT touch these timestamps (confirmed: `src/app/admin/members/[id]/actions.ts:15-16` explicitly skips them).
- **Profile editor** (`/portal/profile`): single-column form with all editable member fields. Profile details section: first_name, last_name, primary email, company_name, company_website, linkedin_profile, attendee_stagetypes (multi-select checkboxes). Intro & Ask section: current_intro (textarea), current_ask (textarea), contact_preference (dropdown: LinkedIn/Email). Single Save button with toast. Same timestamp logic as portal home form — `intro_updated_at`/`ask_updated_at` only set when respective text changes. Primary email change: if new email exists in member_emails, flips primary via `swap_primary_email` RPC; if new email, inserts row with `source = 'manual'` then flips. Old email rows persist as secondary.
- **Community directory** (`/portal/community`): searchable, sortable table of members with `has_community_access = true` and `kicked_out = false`. Columns: Name, Company, Role. Search hits: first_name, last_name, full name, company_name, company_website, linkedin_profile, current_intro, current_ask, contact_preference, attendee_stagetypes. Default sort: first_name ascending. All columns sortable. Uses `fetchAll` with `.range()` for pagination past 1,000-row PostgREST cap (470 community members). All rows rendered client-side after full fetch. Row click routes to `/portal/members/[id]`.
- **Member profile page** (`/portal/members/[id]`): read-only view of a member's profile for other community members. Shows: name, company, website (link), LinkedIn (link), role (formatted), primary email, preferred contact (capitalized), intro, ask. No demographics (gender/race/orientation — those live on applications only). Returns 404 if member is `kicked_out = true` or `has_community_access = false`. Self-view: shows "Edit Profile" button linking to `/portal/profile` when viewer's member_id matches the page's member.
- **Recap page** (`/portal/recap`): shows attendees of the most recent completed dinner (latest `dinners.date < today` in MT). Attendees = members with a `fulfillment_status = 'fulfilled'` ticket for that dinner. Excluded: kicked-out, `has_community_access = false`, refunded, credited, pending tickets. Marketing-opted-out still shown. Deduplicated by member_id (qty=2 tickets show one row for the primary member). Each card shows name (links to `/portal/members/[id]`), company, full intro text, full ask text. Empty intro/ask hidden (only show what they have). Header: "Thunderview Dinner — [formatted date]" with attendee count. Members with intros/asks sorted first, then others. Empty state for no past dinners.
- **Profile pictures** (Sprints 6–7): Supabase Storage bucket `profile-pics` (public-read, authenticated-write, RLS: members can only upload at their own member_id path). Column `members.profile_pic_url` TEXT NULL stores full public URL with `?v={timestamp}` cache-bust. Upload on `/portal/profile`: client-side crop via `react-easy-crop` (square aspect, zoom 1–3) in a modal (`crop-modal.tsx`), then server-side processing via `sharp` — resize to 400×400, convert to WebP, strip EXIF. HEIC files skip client crop (browser can't render) and fall back to server center-crop. Max 5MB, accepts JPEG/PNG/WebP/HEIC. Stored at `profile-pics/{member_id}.webp` (upsert overwrites). Photo saves immediately on crop Apply (spinner overlay shown). Reusable `<MemberAvatar>` component (`src/components/member-avatar.tsx`): shows pic if set, initials circle if not. Sizes: sm (28px), md (40px), lg (120px). Displayed in 7 locations: portal profile upload, portal member profile page, community table rows, recap cards, top-nav dropdown trigger, admin member detail heading, admin members table rows, admin dinner detail ticket rows.

## What's NOT done

Don't build these without an explicit prompt:

- Fulfill ticket button (manual fulfillment for tickets not auto-fulfilled) — Phase 3+
- `has_community_access` revoke checkbox on refund flow — allows manual revert to `false` when refunding a ticket (Phase 3+)
- Application form (will be hosted on Thunderview OS, not Squarespace) — Phase 3
- Attendee portal: Phase 4 complete (portal home, profile editor, community directory, recap page all done).
- Email sending (Resend wiring) — Phase 3+. TODOs in approve/reject actions mark where emails should fire. Template #1: new member approval ("you're approved, buy a ticket"). Template #2: re-application/linked ("you're already in, just buy a ticket next time"). Template #3: rejection.
- Stripe payment integration for ticket purchases (currently writes ticket row with no payment) — Phase 5
- Ticket purchase integration via Squarespace webhooks — Phase 5, blocked on Squarespace plan upgrade
- Bulk email templates — Phase 4
- Streak API integration — Phase 5
- CoachingOS sync — Phase 6
- LinkedIn URL matching for automatic duplicate detection across applications and members
- Side-by-side comparison when re-application has different data than existing member record (name, company, website changes)
- Automatic member field updates from re-application data

## Upcoming work

**Phase 3: Admin actions + application form + transactional emails (next up)**

Remaining Phase 3 work:
- Application form (hosted on Thunderview OS, replacing Squarespace)
- Transactional emails via Resend (approval notifications, magic links with custom branding)

## Pre-launch checklist (before real users hit this)

- [ ] Switch Supabase SMTP from built-in to Resend
- [ ] Verify Thunderview sending domain in Resend (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Customize magic link email template (subject, body, branding) — link format already fixed, but copy/styling still default
- [x] Verified all Supabase auth email templates use the `/auth/confirm?token_hash=...&type=email` pattern (not `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`)
- [ ] Confirm From address is a Thunderview domain (no `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io`)
- [ ] Confirm injected unsubscribe footer is gone
- [ ] Set Vercel preview env vars (currently missing anon key + service role key in preview scope)

## Known issues / gotchas

- **PKCE flow uses `/auth/confirm`, not `/auth/callback`.** The `@supabase/ssr` package defaults to PKCE. Supabase's magic link email template generates URLs with `token_hash` query param pointing to `/auth/confirm`. The `/auth/callback` route (code exchange) also exists as a fallback. Both routes create their own `createServerClient` inline with direct `cookieStore` access — do not use the shared `lib/supabase/server.ts` helper in auth routes, as cookies won't propagate on redirects.
- **Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`.** The file is `src/proxy.ts` with `export async function proxy(request)`. The `middleware` convention is deprecated.
- **Vercel preview env vars partially missing.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are not set for the preview environment due to a Vercel CLI plugin bug. Add manually in Vercel dashboard if branch deploys are needed.
- **Supabase built-in SMTP is rate-limited.** Magic link requests are capped at 1 per 60 seconds per email, with an hourly sending cap. Must switch to Resend before launch.
- **Supabase/PostgREST default row cap.** Supabase limits query results to 1,000 rows by default. This is silent — no error, just truncated results. Any query that might return more than 1,000 rows MUST paginate. This has caused bugs across multiple projects. Always account for it.
- **Portal pages use admin client for data queries.** RLS policies on most tables (tickets, dinners, applications, members) only grant SELECT to admin/team. Portal pages authenticate the user via the session client (`createClient`), then use the admin client (`createAdminClient`) for all data reads and writes. This is the same pattern as the `/apply` form.
- **Server action body size limit is 5MB** (set in `next.config.ts` under `experimental.serverActions.bodySizeLimit`). Default Next.js limit is 1MB. Raised because profile pic uploads send a PNG blob from the client-side crop canvas, which can exceed 1MB for larger source images. If this limit needs changing, it's in `next.config.ts`.
